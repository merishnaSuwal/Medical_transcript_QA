# Medical Transcript Question Answering (MTQA)

## Overview

The Medical Transcript Question Answering (MTQA) project focuses on developing a system for efficiently extracting information from medical transcripts through the implementation of state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, practitioners, and developers interested in exploring, understanding, and contributing to the MTQA project.

## Features

- **Question Answering System:** A robust system designed to extract answers from medical transcripts in response to user queries.
- **BERT-based Models:** Utilizes pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models for improved understanding of medical context.
- **Tokenization and Embedding:** Implements advanced tokenization and embedding techniques tailored for medical language processing.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone Repository:**

```git clone https://github.com/merishnaSuwal/Medical_transcript_QA.git```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. **Explore the notebooks:**
Check out Jupyter notebook in the `QA_medical_transcripts.ipynb` for hands-on training and experimentation on medical transcripts data. Click `Open in Colab` for easier execution.
