# BERT Fine-Tuning

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for fine-tuning BERT models for specific NLP tasks: 

1. Medical Transcripts Question Answering (MTQA) 
2. Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition (CyberNER)

The notebooks provide step-by-step guidance on loading pre-trained BERT models, preparing datasets, and fine-tuning for these specific tasks.

## Notebooks

### 1. Medical Transcripts QA (MTQA)

- `MTQA_FineTuning.ipynb`: Fine-tunes a BERT model for Medical Transcripts QA and demonstrates how to use the fine-tuned model for inference.

### 2. Cybersecurity NER (CyberNER)

- `CyberNER_FineTuning.ipynb`: Fine-tunes a BERT model for Cybersecurity NER and demonstrates how to use the fine-tuned model for inference.

## Getting Started

Click on `Open in Colab` within the notebook in GitHub to get started.

## Datasets

The data directory contains datasets for MTQA and CyberNER.
